# GraphQL-based CRUD API

Welcome to the GraphQL-based CRUD API repository! This repository provides a comprehensive solution for building a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using GraphQL. 

## Overview
GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. This repository leverages GraphQL to create a flexible and efficient API for performing CRUD operations on various resources.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for your data models.
- **GraphQL Schema**: Define your data models and operations using GraphQL schema language.
- **Flexible Queries**: Clients can specify exactly what data they need, minimizing the amount of data transferred over the network.
- **Type Safety**: GraphQL schemas provide strong type checking, ensuring data integrity and reducing runtime errors.
- **Custom Resolvers**: Easily extend functionality by adding custom resolvers to handle complex data operations.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for scalability and performance, suitable for small to large-scale applications.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started with the GraphQL-based CRUD API:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevShubX/Graphql-CRUD-API.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   ```bash
   cd GraphQL-CRUD-API
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**: 
   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure your environment variables such as database connection details.

4. **Start the Server**: 
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the GraphQL server.

5. **Explore the API**: 
   Once the server is running, you can explore the GraphQL API by navigating to `http://localhost:port/graphql` in your browser or using a tool like [GraphQL Playground](https://www.graphqlbin.com

/).

## Usage
- **Creating Data**: Use GraphQL mutations to create new records.
- **Reading Data**: Query existing records with GraphQL queries.
- **Updating Data**: Update records using GraphQL mutations.
- **Deleting Data**: Remove records using GraphQL mutations.

## Examples
Here are some example GraphQL queries and mutations to get you started:

### Querying Users
```graphql
query {
  users {
    id
    Name
    Age
    Email
  }
}
```
### Querying User By Id
```graphql
query {
  users(id: "user_id_here") {
    id
    Name
    Age
    Email
  }
}
```

### Adding User
```graphql
mutation {
  addUser(name: "user_name" , age : user_age , email : "user_email") {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```
### Deleting User
```graphql
mutation {
  deleteUser(id: "user_id_here") {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```
